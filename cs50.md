Emoji, control, command space = all bits

Computers only understand binary system

001 = 1
010 = 2
100 = 3
111 = 7

it's just a pattern to save space as in decimal
Just because it is easier for the computer to understand and operates

binary 

2^2 2^1 2^0
4   2   1         = 7  😁

72 73 33

- 01001000  01001001  00100001  = HI!  24bit
- unicode is 32bit at the moment 2^8 256 patterns
- 000 000 000 each has pattern each pattern has 256 because of 2^8
- 7 >> 8 >> 16 >> 24 >> 32 all started from the rainbow
- music pictures etc, based on the bits = analog human reality
- algorithms = solving the sequence of 0s and 1s, ex. going through the phone book to find the name. Several ways but what is the most efficient way? 


Ex. pseudocode for looking up the person in th ephone book
**Binary Search**

1. pick uo the phone book
2. Open to the middle of the book
3. Look at the page
4.  If person is on page
5.    Call person
6. Else if persoon is earlier in book
7.    open to middle left half of book
8.    Go back to line 3
9. Else if person is later in book
10.   Open to middle of right half of book
11.   Go back to line 3
12. Else
13. Quit
