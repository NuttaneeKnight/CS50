Emoji, control, command space = all bits

Computers only understand binary system

001 = 1
010 = 2
100 = 3
111 = 7

it's just a pattern to save space as in decimal
Just because it is easier for the computer to understand and operates

binary 

2^2 2^1 2^0
4   2   1         = 7  😁

72 73 33

H I !

- 01001000  01001001  00100001  = HI!  24bit
- unicode is 32bit at the moment 2^8 256 patterns
- 000 000 000 each has pattern each pattern has 256 because of 2^8
- 7 >> 8 >> 16 >> 24 >> 32 all started from the rainbow
- music pictures etc, based on the bits = analog human reality
- algorithms = solving the sequence of 0s and 1s, ex. going through the phone book to find the name. Several ways but what is the most efficient way?
